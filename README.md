# Patient Referral Form <a name="about-project"></a>

The frontend code in this repository pertains to the Patient Referral Form, a React-based web application aimed at enhancing the patient referral process within the healthcare sector. This application, designed to optimize efficiency and user experience, simplifies the transfer of patients from one healthcare provider to another. The project served as a sample take-home assignment, where I successfully implemented the Patient Referral Form based on Figma designs.
